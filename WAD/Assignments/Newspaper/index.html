            <p>Twitter has fired the majority of its over 200 employees in India as part of mass layoffs across the globe ordered by its new owner Elon Musk who is looking to make his $44 billion acquisition work.

                Sources said the layoffs are across engineering, sales and marketing, and communications teams.
                
                However, there is no clarity yet on the severance package to be paid to employees laid off in India.Mr. Musk has blamed activists for a significant drop in the company's revenues.

                "Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists. Extremely messed up! They're trying to destroy free speech in America," Mr. Musk tweeted.
                
                The company posted a net loss of $270 million in the second quarter that ended June 30, 2022, compared to a profit of $66 million in the same period a year ago.
                
                The revenue of Twitter had declined to $1,176 million during the June 2022 quarter from USD 1,190 million a year ago. Advertisement revenue had increased by 2% to USD 1.08 billion while subscription and other revenue declined by 27% to $101 million on a year-over-year basis.</p>
